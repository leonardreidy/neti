## READYOU
A 'READYOU' or 'READYOU.md' is a type of document I invented to solve a specific need, i.e.
to act as a temporary touchpoint for notes about a project that has been initialized from a
repository fork, template, or other 'base'. Its purpose is to capture notes about the context
of a piece of work right at the beginning with a view to replacing the README at some unspecified
point in the future. Hence the name, which is an invitation to read, and a cue for context.
